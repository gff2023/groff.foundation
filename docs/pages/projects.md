## Current Projects

The Foundation is currently working with Shepherdstown Elementary School to replace and upgrade pedestrian safety equipment near the area utilized for morning student drop off. The current assortment of worn out and broken traffic cones will be replaced with new lime green cones with reflective tap designed to clearly deliniate pedestrian from vehicle traffic.
