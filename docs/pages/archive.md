April 2023 - The Foundation replaced and upgraded pedestrian safety equipment along the student droff off area at Shepherdstown Elementary School. An assortment of worn out and broken traffic cones was replaced with eight new lime green cones with reflective tap designed to clearly deliniate pedestrian from vehicle traffic.

March 2023 - The Foundation raised $310 for the Shepherd University Enviornmental Studies Student Experience Fund. A total of $155 was donated by contributors to this campaing and this was matched by the Foundation. The gift to the Student Experience Fund will specifically be used to help defray costs for students to travel to Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks this summer as part of a field course. Thank you to Corey Anderson, Linda Yoder, Sue Overman, Andrianne Dering, and Jennifer Lindsay for their generous support.
